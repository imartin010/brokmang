## 🧪 Test Flow

4. **Click "Sign In"**
5. **Check console** for logs:
   - "Attempting sign in..."
   - "Sign in successful! Session: [user-id]"
   - "User profile: [profile-data]"
6. **Should redirect** to `/dashboard`

## ✅ Expected Behavior

### If User Has Profile:
```
Sign In → Dashboard → Shows content based on role ✅
```

### If User Has No Profile:
```
Sign In → Dashboard → Redirects to /select-role → Choose role → Dashboard ✅
```

## 🔍 Debugging

**Check browser console for:**
- ✅ "Attempting sign in..." - Form submitted
- ✅ "Sign in successful!" - Auth worked
- ✅ "User profile: ..." - Profile check result

**If errors:**
- Check console for detailed error messages
- Check Network tab for failed requests
- Verify user_profiles table exists in Supabase
