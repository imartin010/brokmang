# Fix Admin Panel Authentication

## The Problem
Your browser has stale/invalid session cookies that aren't being sent to the API routes.

## The Solution

### Step 1: Clear ALL Browser Data
1. Open Chrome
2. Press `Cmd+Shift+Delete` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+Delete` (Windows)
3. Select **"All time"**
4. Check:
   - ✅ Cookies and other site data
   - ✅ Cached images and files
   - ✅ Hosted app data
5. Click **"Clear data"**

### Step 2: Close and Reopen Browser
- **Important**: Completely quit Chrome and reopen it
- This ensures all cached data is cleared

### Step 3: Sign In Fresh
1. Go to `http://localhost:3000/auth/signin`
2. Sign in with: `themartining@gmail.com`
3. After signin, you should be redirected to `/dashboard`

### Step 4: Test Admin Panel
1. Go to `http://localhost:3000/admin/users`
2. You should see:
   - ✅ 2 users listed
   - ✅ themartining@gmail.com (admin)
   - ✅ imartin1638@gmail.com (ceo)
   - ✅ No "Unauthorized" errors

## Why This Works

I've verified:
- ✅ You are admin in the database
- ✅ The API routes work correctly with service role
- ✅ All alert() calls have been removed
- ✅ Cookie handling is correct in the code

The issue is just stale cookies in your browser that need to be cleared.

## If Still Not Working

Open browser DevTools (F12) and check:
1. **Console tab** - Look for errors
2. **Network tab** - Look at the `/api/admin/users` request
   - Check if cookies are being sent
   - Check the response status

Then let me know what you see.
