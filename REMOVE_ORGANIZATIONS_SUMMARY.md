## SQL Migration Required

Run the migration script to remove organization-related database structures:

```sql
-- Run this file:
supabase/remove-organizations.sql
```

This will:
- Drop organization tables (organizations, memberships, branches, teams, etc.)
- Remove org_id columns from all tables
- Drop organization-related functions
- Remove organization-related indexes

## Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Data Loss Warning**: This migration will DELETE all organization, membership, branch, and team data. Make sure to backup your database before running.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Breaking Changes**: All features that depended on organization context will need to be updated to work with user_id only.

‚ö†Ô∏è **RLS Policies**: After removing organizations, RLS policies need to be simplified to use user_id-based access control instead of org_id-based isolation.
