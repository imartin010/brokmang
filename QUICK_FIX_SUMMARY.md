# ✅ User Type Fetching Issue - FIXED

## What Was the Problem?

When you changed the user type in the dashboard, the database updated successfully but the frontend couldn't fetch/display the new usertype.

## What Was Fixed?

### 1. ✅ Immediate State Update on Change
- When user type is changed, Zustand state now updates **immediately** before redirecting
- File: `app/select-account-type/page.tsx`

### 2. ✅ Real-Time Sync Across All Pages
- Added Supabase Realtime subscription to listen for user_type changes
- The Navbar now automatically updates when user_type changes in the database
- Works even if changed from another tab or by an admin
- File: `components/navbar.tsx`

### 3. ✅ Database Realtime Configuration
- Created migration to enable Supabase Realtime for `sales_agents` table
- File: `supabase/enable-realtime-sales-agents.sql`

## 🚀 Quick Setup (REQUIRED)

You need to run ONE SQL command in your Supabase dashboard:

### Step 1: Open Supabase SQL Editor
1. Go to your Supabase project
2. Click "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar

### Step 2: Run This SQL
```sql
-- Enable realtime for sales_agents table
ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE public.sales_agents;

-- Set replica identity to FULL
ALTER TABLE public.sales_agents REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;
```

### Step 3: Verify (Optional)
```sql
SELECT schemaname, tablename 
FROM pg_publication_tables 
WHERE pubname = 'supabase_realtime';
```

You should see `sales_agents` in the results.

## ✨ What You Get Now
