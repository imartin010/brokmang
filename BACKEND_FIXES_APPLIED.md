# ‚úÖ Backend Conflicts Fixed

## Summary
Fixed critical database conflicts found in backend API routes.

**Date:** November 1, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Critical Issues Fixed

---

## üîß Fixes Applied

### ‚úÖ Fix #1: `agent_daily_logs` Query - Column Names
**File:** `app/api/public/agents/[id]/performance/route.ts`

**Issue:**
- Query was selecting `deals, revenue` which don't exist
- Query was filtering by `org_id` which may not exist

**Fix Applied:**
```typescript
// BEFORE (WRONG):
.select("deals, revenue")
.eq("user_id", userId)
.eq("org_id", auth.orgId)

// AFTER (CORRECT):
.select("agent_id, log_date, calls_count, meetings_count, sales_amount")
.eq("agent_id", userId)
// Removed org_id filter (column doesn't exist)

// Updated totals calculation:
acc.deals += row.meetings_count || 0;
acc.revenue += Number(row.sales_amount) || 0;
```

**Result:** ‚úÖ Query now uses correct column names that exist in database

### ‚úÖ Fix #2: `break_even_records` Query - org_id Removed
**File:** `app/api/public/breakeven/current/route.ts`

**Issue:**
- Query was filtering by `org_id` which was removed from table
- Table only has `user_id` column

**Fix Applied:**
- Temporarily returns 501 error as this endpoint needs full refactoring
- The public API uses `orgId` from tokens, but organizations were removed
- **Recommendation:** This endpoint should be refactored or removed since it depends on organization-based tokens

**Result:** ‚úÖ Prevents query failure, but endpoint needs design decision

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Remaining Issues

### Issue #1: Public API Token System
**Status:** Needs Design Decision

**Problem:**
- `validateApiToken()` returns `orgId` 
- `api_tokens` table likely has `org_id` column
- Organizations were removed from system
- Public API endpoints depend on organization-based tokens

**Options:**
1. **Remove Public API** - If not needed, remove these endpoints
2. **Refactor to User-Based** - Update `api_tokens` to use `user_id` instead
3. **Keep for Future** - Keep structure but mark as deprecated

**Recommendation:** Check if public API is being used. If not, remove it.

---

### Issue #2: Other `org_id` References
**Files to Check:**
- `app/api/internal/notify/route.ts`
- `app/api/internal/audit/route.ts`
- `app/api/cron/subscription-check/route.ts`

**Status:** Need verification if these are still used and if they reference `org_id`

---

## ‚úÖ Verified Working

1. ‚úÖ Main subscription system (uses `user_id`)
2. ‚úÖ Insights generation (uses `user_id`)
3. ‚úÖ User profiles (uses `user_id`)
4. ‚úÖ Sales agents queries (uses `full_name`)
5. ‚úÖ Daily logs queries (correct column names now)

---

## üìã Next Steps

1. **Verify Public API Usage**
   - Check if `/api/public/*` endpoints are being used
   - If not used: Remove or deprecate
   - If used: Refactor to user-based tokens

2. **Check Other API Routes**
   - Review `app/api/internal/*` routes for `org_id` usage
   - Update or remove as needed

3. **Update API Documentation**
   - Document which endpoints are deprecated
   - Update API docs to reflect new structure

4. **Run Full Test Suite**
   - Test all API endpoints
   - Verify no other conflicts exist

## üìä Status Summary

| Issue | Status | Priority |
|-------|--------|----------|
| agent_daily_logs column names | ‚úÖ Fixed | High |
| break_even_records org_id | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Fixed | High |
| Public API token system | ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Decision | Medium |
| Other org_id references | ‚è≥ Pending Check | Medium |

**Overall:** ‚úÖ Critical query issues fixed. Some endpoints need design decisions.
