# ✅ Subscription System - Complete & Ready

## Summary

The subscription system is now fully functional **without organizations**. Admins can validate payments for all users.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Run Database Migrations (Required)

Run these 3 SQL files in Supabase SQL Editor **in this order**:

```sql
-- 1. Fix subscriptions table (remove org_id)
-- File: supabase/fix-subscriptions-schema.sql
```

```sql
-- 2. Create storage bucket for payment screenshots  
-- File: supabase/create-payment-screenshots-bucket.sql
```

```sql
-- 3. Add admin role support
-- File: supabase/add-admin-role.sql
```

### 2. Create Your First Admin User

In Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Replace with your email
UPDATE user_profiles 
SET user_type = 'admin' 
WHERE user_id = (
  SELECT id FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'YOUR_ADMIN_EMAIL@example.com'
);

-- Verify
SELECT u.email, up.user_type 
FROM user_profiles up
JOIN auth.users u ON u.id = up.user_id
WHERE up.user_type = 'admin';
```

## How It Works

### User Types

1. **CEO** - Business owner, full access to all features
2. **Team Leader** - Sales manager, limited features
3. **Admin** - Payment validator, can approve/reject subscriptions

### Payment Flow

```
User pays via InstaPay
  ↓
Uploads screenshot + enters reference
  ↓
Submits payment request
  ↓
Admin receives notification
  ↓
Admin reviews at /admin/subscriptions
  ↓
Admin approves or rejects
  ↓
User receives notification
  ↓
AI features unlock (if approved)
```
